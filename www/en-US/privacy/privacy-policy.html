                        <h1>Your privacy is our priority</h1>
                        <p>At Image Improv LLC., we are absolutely committed to your privacy. We know that we must earn your trust—and keep it—every time you use ImageImprov and our other products. To make good on that promise, we’ve created this Privacy Center, where you’ll find a wealth of info about our approach to privacy.</p>
                        <p></p>All of Image Improv’s features you know and love were created by a small team of people, right here in the U.S of A. The people who build these and other Image Improv LLC. products care deeply about privacy on a very personal level. New features go through an intense privacy review process—we talk about things, we debate them, and we work hard to build products we’re proud of and that we’ll want to use. After all, we use these products constantly, both at work and in our personal lives, and we handle your information with the same care that we use for ourselves, our family, and our friends.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning, the way we treat your information has been very different from other technology companies. The ImageImprov app is constantly evolving and adding new features, but our privacy principles remain unchanged.</p>
                        <p>Have a great day!</p>

                        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                        There are three basic categories of information we collect:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information you choose to give us.</li>
                            <li>Information we get when you use our services.</li>
                            <li>Iformation we get from third parties.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>
                        <h3>Information You Choose to Give Us</h3>
                        When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, to enhance your experience you may decide to set up a basic Image Improv account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you’d like to go by, a password, and an email address.

                        <h3>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</h3>
                        When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We know you’ve uploaded a photo, or that you have voted on numerous photos taken by other members of the community.
                        <p><b>Usage Information.</b> We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:</p>
                        <p>how you interact with the services, such as how often you vote, how often you upload photos.</p>
                            <p><b>Content Information.</b> We collect information about the content you provide, the photograph you uploaded and any metadata that may be contained in it.</p>
                            <p><b>Device Information.</b> We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</p>
                            <p><b>Camera and Photos.</b> Our service requires us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos.</p>
                            <p><b>Location Information.</b> When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</p>
                            <p><b>Log Information.</b> We also collect log information when you use our application. That information includes, among other things:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>details about how you’ve used our services.</li>
                                <li>device information, such as your web browser type and language.</li>

                                <li>IP address.</li>
                                <li>Frequency of usage of our services</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Information We Collect from Third Parties</b></p>
                        <p>Currently we don’t have any Third Party services that we work with, so nothing to talk about.</p>

                        <p>send you communications, including by email. For example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.</p>

                        <p>Image Improv will archive all photographs uploaded for an indeterminate time. We will maintain the association between your Image Improv account and the photographs you uploaded even after you have deleted your account.</p>
                        <p>Some of the log information we collect on site operation will be periodically purged from our systems. We may need to suspend these deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content or if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p>

                        <h2>Control over Your Information</h2>
                        <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.</p>
                        <p><b>Access and Updates.</b> We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the app by visiting the app’s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We will try to update and access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with your request.</p>
                        <p><b>Revoking Permissions.</b> If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</p>
                        <p><b>Account Deletion.</b> While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong user of Image Improv, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here. If you ask to delete your account, you will have up to 30 days to restore your account before we delete your information from our servers. During this period, your account will not be visible to other Image Improv users.</p>
                        <p><b>Communicating with other Image Improv Users.</b> Currently our platform does not facilitate communicate between Image Improv users. Our future plans will definitely have community features and this privacy policy will be updated to reflect how that information will be used.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Users Outside the United States</h2>
                        <p>Although we welcome Image Improv Users from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, your information may be shared within the Image Improv family of companies. This means that we may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live.</p>

                        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).</p>

                    <h3>In a nutshell</h3>
                    <p>ImageImprov is a fun way to express yourself. You can share your interpretation of the daily theme with the ImageImprov community and showcase your talent for all to see.</p>
                    <p>When you use this service—and any others we roll out—you’ll share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.</p>
                    <p>That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just <a href="mailto:feedback@imageimprov.com">contact us</a>.</p>
